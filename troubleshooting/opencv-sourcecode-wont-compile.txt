#tool: opencv, c++ (cpp)
#version: all
#OS: (linux)

#subject: opencv sourcecode won't compile when generating a c++ (cpp) binary:
#user@host:~$ g++ sourcecode.cpp -o binary
#(error output)

#reason: when working with c++ source code, the compiler needs to know where to find opencv libraries.

#solution: A directive must be added to the compilation line, indicating where to find opencv libraries.
#The following line must be added:   `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`

#an output similar to this should appear:

user@host:~$ g++ sourcecode.cpp -o binary `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`
user@host:~$
